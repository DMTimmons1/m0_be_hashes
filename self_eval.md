# Self Evaluation

1. What did you struggle with in this section?
  - I struggled a little with the syntax clean up. Since there's not super clear directions just "Clean up the syntax". It was easy to get stuck on since I was wondering if there's even more you can do to clean it up.

1. How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - note taking is going good! I write down the vocab and any processes during the section. even if I don't refer back to the notes, just writing it down helps my brain absorb the information.

1. What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
 - Defnitely try to solve the problem on my own first. I feel like I do a disservice to myself if I default to google. Trying to figure it out will expand my thought process and will help me troubleshoot in the future.
